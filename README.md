# Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices

- This is the first project of my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree journey.

- To view my work, open the boston_housing_prices.ipynb file. The rest are supporting files or less readable formats of the same work.

- As the name suggests, this project is centered on the creation of a machine learning model capable of predicting the selling prices of homes in the Boston area.

- The format of this project is Python code blocks with my contributions including the word 'Implementation' in the section header, and with the 'TODO' keyword in the comments preceding my code contribution. 

- Furthermore, there are 11 conceptual questions that I have answered thoroughly and demonstrate my understanding of the data and the work that I engaged in with it.

# Main Concepts
- The main machine learning concepts covered in this project include the following:

- Data Exploration: This includes understanding the features of the dataset and the basic statistics of the data such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Model Development: Defined a performace metric(R2 score), and split the dataset in a sensible way.
- Analyzing Model Performance: Learning and complexity curves used to understand the performance achieved by the model. 
- Evaluating Model Performance: Discussed and made use of techniques such as Grid Search and K-fold Cross Validation to tune hyperparameters and make sure that model derives strong insights from the data. Then, made predictions with the model and made a determination as to whether the model in its current form is ready to be used in the real world.
